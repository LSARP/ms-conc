This repository contains an app for standardizing metabolomics data by using standard samples that incorporates a novel algorithm for detecting linear ranges in a set of (x,y) points covering several orders of magnitude. 
The app was created for mass spectrometry generated data although it can be used in data with similar structure.
The app can work with data generated from Maven or Mint program although that information should be provided.
